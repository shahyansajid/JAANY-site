                            <p class="new-para2">The Japanese American Association of New York, Inc. is celebrating its 100th Anniversary from April 2007 to May 2008. It recently held                                 its Centennial Gala fundraiser on September 29, 2007 at the Frederick P. Rose Hall, the new home of Jazz at Lincoln Center.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">This was JAA's first major fundraiser. Thanks to the strong positive response from the corporate sector and local community the Gala was                               a big success. The sold out event was attended by 400 people dressed in black tie, evening wear and Japanese kimono. Outside its enormous two-story                                         windows, a luminous full moon hung in the sky, illuminating the Manhattan skyline and Central Park throughout this magical evening. Guests entered the                                  amphitheater like Allen Room to the sound of dramatic drumming by taiko performers from Soh Daiko.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">Throughout the evening, guests were also entertained by musicians from Asian Artists in Concert, Inc., The Young People's Chorus and                                   main performer of the evening, jazz pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">Special guests included United States Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Ambassador Ryozo Kato (Ambassador to the United States from Japan),                                    Ambassador Motoatsu Sakurai (Consul General, New York), Ms. Irene Hirano (President, Japanese American National Musuem), Dr. Richard Wood (President,                                   Japan Society) and New York City Councilman John C. Liu. </p>

                            <p class="new-para2">The dinner program was smoothly and humorously emceed by master and mistress of ceremonies Fred Katayama (Reuters, Inc.) and Kaoriko                                   Kuge (Fujisankei Communications). Greetings of welcome were given by Gala co-chairman Gary S. Moriwaki and celebratory toast given by Dr. Robert Emy.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">During dinner, a video of JAA's history and the history of the Japanese presence in the New York area over the last 100 years was shown.                               Much of the commitment and energy that continues within JAA today can be traced back to its founder Dr. Toyohiko Takami. It was a great tribute to JAA and                              its founder that twenty six members of the Takami family flew from across the country to attend the Gala, including grandson, Dr. Tadataka Yamada who was                               recently knighted by the Queen of England. Past JAA presidents, Noboru Sato, Dr. Robert Emy and Toshio Kiso were also present as was Mrs. Chieko Inagaki,                                   recent widow of long time JAA President Shigeru Inagaki.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">Current JAA President Susan J. Onuma gave her greetings thanking many for their support and emphasizing the need for Japanese and                                  Japanese Americans to work together and the importance of JAA's role to serve as a bridge between the two groups. After her greetings, a special Certificate                                of Commendation from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan was presented to JAA by Ambassador Motoatsu Sakurai in recognition of JAA's many achievements                             over the last 100 years.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">Following in the vein of enhancing relations between Japanese and Japanese Americans, Ambassador Kato and Senator Inouye were presented                            with the JAA Centennial Leadership Award for dedicating their lives to public service and for working closely together to bring mutual understanding to the                                 Japanese and Japanese American community. Both recipients gave very moving and inspiring acceptance speeches from their respective experiences and                                      viewpoints.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">The backbone of any not for profit organization is its corps of volunteers. JAA has been particularly blessed with having so many                                  dedicated volunteers who have generously given their time for so many years. At the Gala, five people were presented with the JAA Centennial Volunteer Award                                for their many years of past and current service - George Yuzawa, Sanko Kajihara, Dr. Seiichi Shimomura, Dr. Robert K. Emy and Seiko Oshima. Also recognized                            was Ms. Michiyo Noda, JAA's only full time employee - who has been working for JAA for twenty years.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">After a spectacular performance by world renowned Toshiko Akiyoshi (with surprise appearance by Lew Tabackin on saxophone), the evening                            ended with a raffle drawing and closing remarks by Gala Co-chair Hiroko Onoyama.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">It is JAA's hope that many of you will take the time to get to know JAA, participate in our programs and visit the JAA office so that                                  you can also come to appreciate the breadth and depth of the services and activities JAA provides to the community and the dedication of the volunteers                                 and staff of JAA.</p>

                            <p class="new-para2">JAA sincerely thanks everyone for their support as it commences a new century of community service.</p>

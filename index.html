                            <!-- PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE -->
                            
                            It gives me great pleasure to extend my new year greetings as the newly elected President of JAA. Since I was last President in 2005 - 2007, much has                                    happened, the most impactful being the Great East Japan Earthquake of 3/11.<br><br>

                            JAA has raised over $1.4 million since 3/11 and continues to raise and give funds to organizations that nurture special projects or programs in the Tohoku                                  area. In 2013, members of JAA visited affected areas of Tohoku on multiple occasions and met with some of the organizations to whom we donated funds. Our                               focus has been on projects and organizations which are sustainable into the future and with whom JAA can maintain a long term relationship. On the US side,                             JAA worked with other groups such as the Lions Club and the Hoshuko Alumni Association to help clean up areas of Staten Island that were still in great need                            of repair after Hurricane Sandy. When we see video footage of what happened in the Philippines recently, we are reminded all over again about the fragility of                              human life and the unpredictableness of the forces of nature.<br><br>

                            Providing hope for the future is an important role for JAA to play for those in our community who are most vulnerable - the elderly.<br>

                            When I was last President of JAA, the Committee on Aging Issues was established together with the Consulate General of Japan. It was started as a                                           collaborative group of various individuals and organizations whose purpose was to share information and educate each other and the public about issues                                  facing our senior population. Over the last seven years, the activities of this committee has grown significantly. We have a website that is viewed around                              the world, Senior Week in the fall was so successful that it launched Sakura Health Week in the spring. "Week" is actually a misnomer because the event                                 actually goes on for over two weeks with over 1,500 people attending workshops, demonstrations and lectures on all aspects of leading healthy, productive and                               positive lives in the New York area. During the last census it was reported that there is a high number of young children of Japanese heritage living in the                            borough of Manhattan as well as a high percentage of single elderly women. Wouldn't it be nice to put these two groups together as surrogate grandmothers and                           grandchildren?<br><br>

                            In 2014 we look forward to collaborating with other organizations to hold exhibits, panel discussions, screenings and other joint events for educational and                            intellectual exchange. Please join us on February 5 for the opening reception of our first exhibit of the year –“If they came for me today.” And last but not                           least, we look forward to developing the next generation of young leaders in our community. Our Scholarship program has grown over the years and we are                                     currently accepting applications for the Honjo Scholarship for graduate students.<br><br>

                            I thank you for your support and look forward to working with all of you in 2014! Kotoshi mo mata yoroshiku onegai itashimasu. Together let's make a                                    difference.
